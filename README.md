Note: This code works great for updating a single market on oddsportal.com. However, it gets more difficult when trying to get information from multiple markets 
at once. It is also not very preferably for one to have it running in background while working other stuff (we use this code so we CAN work on other stuff instead, remember). 

If one would like help with any of these to to make it work good just for you or if you're a professional sports bettor and want to coorporate with the tech
stuff, feel free to message me or email me at erik.borgesson@hotmail.com
